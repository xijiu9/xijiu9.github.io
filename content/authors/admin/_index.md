  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof Kurt Keutzer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/). I graduated from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), Tsinghua University in 2024, advised by [Prof Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/) and [Prof Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I have been very fortunate to work with [Prof Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan) as a research intern at Nvidia, and to work with [Prof Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) as an student intern in [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).
